# Accurate as of 2nd April, 2024 --> Running VEX V5 Battery Detection Code on Raspberry Pi

# Show your Raspberry Pi OS version.
cat /etc/os-release

# Update packages on your Raspberry Pi OS.
sudo apt-get update

# Check your Python version. Version should be under the 3.9 branch.
python3 --version

# If the version is too new, certain dependencies and libraries are not supported. Follow the instructions below to downgrade/upgrade the python version (instructions taken from https://hub.tcno.co/pi/software/python-update/)
# Make sure the Pi is up to date
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Install packages for downloading python smoothly
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential tk-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline6-dev libdb5.3-dev libgdbm-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev libffi-dev

# Here, we use the Downloads folder as it is usually empty
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.0/Python-3.9.0.tgz

# After the file finishes downloading (takes a long time)
sudo tar zxf Python-3.9.0.tgz
cd Python-3.9.0
sudo ./configure --enable-optimizations

# Check how many cores the CPU has. Run the following command and check the number next to "cores"
lscpu 

# Build python: (replace 4 with the number of cores)
sudo make -j 4

# Install Python3.9 parallel to current version so that no glitches occur
sudo make altinstall

# Install virtualenv and upgrade pip.
python3.9 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip
python3.9 -m pip install --user virtualenv

# Create a Python virtual environment for Arduino Design file 
python3 -m venv ~/ad 

# Run this command whenever you open a new Terminal window/tab to activate the environment.
source ~/ad/bin/activate

# Clone the MediaPipe samples repository with the MediaPipe Raspberry Pi samples.
git clone https://github.com/aasocial/arduinodesigneasonha.git
cd arduinodesigneasonha/object_detection_raspberry_pi/

# Install dependencies required by the sample
sh setup.sh

# Run the program!

python3.9 detect.py

# If there is an error in running the program, install the dependencies again:
sh setup.sh
